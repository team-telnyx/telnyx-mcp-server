# Sample environment configuration for the Telnyx MCP Server azd deployment.
# These values should be set in your azd environment using:
# `azd env set <KEY> <VALUE>`
#
# For secrets, like TELNYX_API_KEY, it's recommended to use the --secret flag:
# `azd env set TELNYX_API_KEY <your-key> --secret`

# Azure specific (azd will prompt for these during `azd init` or `azd env new`)
# AZURE_LOCATION: "eastus"  # Example: Azure region for deployment.
# AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: "<your-subscription-id>" # Your Azure subscription ID.
# AZURE_ENV_NAME: "my-mcp-app-dev" # Your azd environment name.

# Application specific secrets
TELNYX_API_KEY: "<your-telnyx-api-key>" # REQUIRED_SECRET: Your Telnyx API Key. This will be stored securely in Azure Key Vault.

# Application specific configurations (these will be set as App Settings in App Service via Bicep)
# WEBHOOK_ENABLED: "true" # This is hardcoded to "true" in main.bicep as per requirements.
# PYTHON_VERSION: "3.11" # This is set in main.bicep.
# APP_SERVICE_SKU_NAME: "B1" # Basic tier for MVP, set in main.bicep.

# Note: TELNYX_MCP_SERVER_BASE_URL will be automatically derived from the App Service hostname
# and configured as an App Setting by the Bicep template.
